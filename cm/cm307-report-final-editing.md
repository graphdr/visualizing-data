Having substantially completed the portfolio at this point, it is time
for final editing.

The README introduces the reader to your portfolio. It should start with
an image of your best work and an introduction that engages the reader,
giving them a reason to keep reading. Recall that the intended audience
are professional peers or prospective employers.
