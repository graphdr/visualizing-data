Obtaining meaningful data with which to work is one of the most
challenging tasks in the course.

You can identify the specific data sets you intend to work with even
before learning how to download, webscrape, or manipulate the data to
get it into the form we need for graphs. All you need to know to get
started is

  - where to look for data
  - how to classify the data structure

## weekly assignments

Week 1

  - Begin the search for data to satisfy the first display type (D1).

Week 2

  - Finalize the search that started last week. Verify that the
    structure of the proposed data set satisfies the display
    requirements (D1).
  - Begin the search for data to satisfy the next display type (D2).

Weeks 3–7

  - Finalize the search that started last week. Verify that the
    structure of the proposed data set satisfies the display
    requirements.
  - Begin the search for data to satisfy the next display type.

## assignments by display
