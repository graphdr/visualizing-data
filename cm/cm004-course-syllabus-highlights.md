## grades

Grades are earned based on the [Institute
standards](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/grades.html),
for example, an

  - “A” is an *honor grade*
  - “B” is awarded for *thorough competence*
  - “C” indicates that *minimum standards have been met*

There are no exams. The major deliverables and their relative weights
are:

  - (70%) Portfolio of data displays and written critiques
  - (15%) Timely written responses to the reading prompts and the
    presentation prompts
  - (15%) Presenting your work and participating in small-group
    discussions

## homework

Steady and productive weekly progress is the key to success in this
course. Weekly assignments include

**Obtaining data**  
with structures appropriate to the assigned display types.

**R practice problems**  
to learn the skills needed to create the portfolio.

**Readings**  
Start several days before the due date early to give yourself time to
reflect on the reading so that our discussions are meaningful.

**Reading responses**  
in writing (typically one every two weeks) completed before class on the
day of discussion. Again, start these reflective pieces early so you
have time to revise and edit.

**Presenting**  
displays D1 through D7 plus written critiques.

## labs

Lab periods are used for working with software and for presentating and
discussing portfolio work in progress.

  - Week 1 (3 hours) Software studio
  - Week 2 (3 hours) Data studio
  - Week 3 (3 hours) Portfolio studio
  - Week 4–10 (1 hour) Present & discuss data displays D1–D7
  - Week 4–10 (2 hours) Work, collaborate, solve coding problems, write

## attendance

Attendance is required for periods in which we have discussions of
readings and presentations. The penalty for missing more than two of
these periods without a valid excuse is a one-letter-grade course grade
reduction.
